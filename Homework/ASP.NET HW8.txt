3. Does ASP.NET Core 3 handle outgoing HTTP requests as well as incoming requests? If so, what is one
reason that this is important?
The ASP.NET Core routing system handles incoming requests from clients, but it also generates outgoing URLs that conform
to the URL scheme and that can be embedded in web pages. By using the routing system both to handle incoming requests and to
generate outgoing URLs, I can ensure that all the URLs in the application are consistent.
